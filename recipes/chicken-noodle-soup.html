		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			Fabulous, hearty, classic chicken noodle soup awaits. Filled with fresh, tender veggies and a homemade broth from chicken bone. This soup does not
			dissapoint.
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
			<li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
			<li>3 cloves garlic</li>
			<li>1/2 lb. carrots</li>
			<li>1/2 bunch celery</li>
			<li>2 split chicken breasts, bone-in</li>
			<li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
			<li>1 Tbsp dried parsley</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp dried thyme</li>
			<li>1 whole bay leaf</li>
			<li>Freshly cracked pepper</li>
			<li>2-3 tsp salt</li>
			<li>6 oz. egg noodles</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the onion, garlic, and olive oil to a large pot and sauté over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until the
				onions are soft and transparent.
			</li>

			<li>While the onion and garlic are sautéing, wash and slice the carrots and celery. Add them to the pot and continue to sauté for a few minutes more.</li>

			<li>
				Pull the skin and any excess fat from the chicken breasts. Add the breasts to the pot along with the bay leaf, basil, parsley, thyme, some freshly
				cracked pepper, and eight cups of water. Cover the pot, bring it to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for one hour. Make
				sure the pot continues to simmer for the whole hour. If the heat is turned down too low and it is not bubbling away, the chicken will not shred easily.
			</li>

			<li>
				After an hour of simmering, remove the chicken from the pot. Using two forks, pull the meat from the bone and shred it slightly. Season the broth with
				salt. Begin with one teaspoon and add more to your liking. I used 2-3 teaspoons. The flavor of the broth will really pop once the salt is added.
			</li>

			<li>
				Add the noodles to the pot, turn the heat up to high, and boil the noodles until tender (about 7 minutes). Return the shredded chicken to the pot. Taste
				and season again with salt if needed (I didn’t need to). Serve hot!
			</li>
		</ol>
